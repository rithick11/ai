JARVIS - Your Personal AI Assistant
JARVIS is a Python-based desktop AI assistant designed to help you with various tasks through voice commands. It can open applications, search the web, provide time and date, take notes, manage files, perform calculations, generate code, fetch weather information, and search Wikipedia.

Features
Voice Control: Interact with JARVIS using natural language commands.

Application Management: Open and close applications like Chrome, Notepad, Calculator, Spotify, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

Web Search: Perform Google searches directly through voice commands.

Time & Date: Get the current time and date.

Note Taking: Dictate and save notes.

File Management: Create, delete, and rename files.

Calculations: Solve mathematical queries using Wolfram Alpha.

Code Generation: Generate Python code based on your prompts using the Gemini API.

Weather Updates: Get real-time weather information for any location.

Wikipedia Search: Access information from Wikipedia.

Interactive Visualization: A dynamic Pygame interface provides visual feedback.

Prerequisites
Before running JARVIS, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x

pip (Python package installer)

Installation
Clone the repository (or download the app.py file):

git clone <repository_url>
cd JARVIS-Assistant

(Replace <repository_url> with the actual URL of your repository if you have one.)

Install the required Python packages:

pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 wikipedia wolframalpha requests psutil pygame google-generativeai

Obtain API Keys:
JARVIS uses external APIs for certain functionalities. You'll need to obtain API keys and update them in the app.py file:

Wolfram Alpha: Go to Wolfram Alpha Developer to get an App ID.

OpenWeatherMap: Sign up at OpenWeatherMap to get an API key.

Google Gemini API: Obtain an API key from the Google AI Studio.

Open app.py and replace the placeholder API keys in the API_KEYS dictionary:

API_KEYS = {
    'wolframalpha': 'YOUR_WOLFRAMALPHA_API_KEY',
    'openweathermap': 'YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY',
    'gemini': 'YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY'
}

Configure Application Paths (Optional but Recommended):
If you want JARVIS to open specific applications on your system, you'll need to update the self.app_paths dictionary in app.py with the correct executable paths for your operating system.

Example (for Windows):

self.app_paths = {
    'chrome': 'C:/Program Files/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe',
    'notepad': 'notepad.exe',
    'calculator': 'calc.exe',
    'spotify': 'C:/Users/YourUsername/AppData/Roaming/Spotify/Spotify.exe', # Update with your actual Spotify path
    'word': 'WINWORD.EXE',
    'excel': 'EXCEL.exe',
    'powerpoint': 'POWERPNT.exe'
}

Adjust these paths according to your system's installation directories.

Usage
Run the JARVIS assistant:

python app.py

Wake Word:
JARVIS will initialize and listen for the wake word "JARVIS". Once it hears the wake word, you can issue your commands.

Commands:
Here are some example commands you can use:

"JARVIS, open Chrome"

"JARVIS, search for Python programming tutorials"

"JARVIS, what is the current time?"

"JARVIS, take a note: Remember to buy groceries."

"JARVIS, create file mydocument.txt"

"JARVIS, calculate 15 plus 27"

"JARVIS, generate code for a simple to-do list in Python"

"JARVIS, what's the weather in London?"

"JARVIS, Wikipedia, who is Albert Einstein?"

"JARVIS, close Notepad"

"JARVIS, exit JARVIS"

Troubleshooting
Microphone Issues: If JARVIS isn't responding, check your microphone settings and ensure it's properly configured. You might need to adjust self.recognizer.energy_threshold in app.py.

API Key Errors: Double-check that your API keys are correctly entered in app.py.

Application Paths: Ensure the paths in self.app_paths are accurate for your system.

Internet Connection: Some features (web search, weather, Wolfram Alpha, Gemini, Wikipedia) require an active internet connection.
